# Nanokwant

This is a project for lightweight and fast 1D tight-binding calculations.

## Toolset

- This project uses `pixi`, to execute commands with pixi use `pixi run <command>` (e.g. `pixi run pytest`).
- Always install dependencies using pixi CLI (`pixi add <package>` for conda and `pixi add --pypi <package>` for pypi).
- The docs use `mkdocs` with `mkdocs-execute-plugin` to run code snippets.
